        <h2>About Daffa Abiyyu</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am a Software Engineering student at Gadjah Mada University with a strong curiosity and a 
            passion for learning. I am always excited to take on new challenges, especially in 
            programming. I have skills in several programming languages like Python and C++. I believe 
            that every opportunity, whether it's a project, training, or experience, is a chance to grow and 
            improve. I am open to any opportunities that come my way, whether to sharpen my technical 
            skills or to improve my teamwork and collaboration abilities. I am known for being adaptable, 
            a fast learner, and committed to completing tasks to the best of my ability. With a strong drive 
            to keep learning and growing from every experience, I am excited to contribute and make the 
            most of every opportunity in the ever-evolving world of technology. (Very sigma and mewing.)</p>
